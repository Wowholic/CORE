CORE makes you faster and more efficient when developing custom WordPress sites.

== Description ==

### CORE: WordPress utilities

CORE is a utility-based, unintrusive WordPress plugin. It offers a simple UI to tweak many sensible default settings to quickstart your new fresh WordPress project. It's recommended for developers building custom themes with ACF.

CORE builds on top of Wowholicâ€™s +5 years of experience developing fully custom WordPress sites, for all sorts of customers and industries. We made this plugin to be more efficient and productive in our own work, and we hope it helps you too!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I changed the upload size limit, but nothing happened =

You might have noticed that below the upload size limit option, there is the "Hosting provider size limit" label. This indicates the size limit set by your hosting provider. No plugin can modify that value, only you can do it (if given enough permissions). Otherwise, contact your hosting support for help.

= How do I use the email shortcode? =

You can use the email shortcode in any content field that accepts shortcodes. Here's an example: `[email]example@gmail.com[/email]`
