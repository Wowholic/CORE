## How to use GitHub

We use GitHub exclusively for well-documented bugs, feature requests and code contributions. Communication is always done in English.

To receive free support for CORE, you can do so in the [support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/core) on WordPress.org.

## I have found a bug

Before opening a new issue, please:

- update to the newest versions of WordPress and CORE.
- search for duplicate issues to prevent opening a duplicate issue. If there is already an open existing issue, please comment on that issue.
- follow our _New issue_ template when creating a new issue.
- add as much information as possible. For example: add screenshots, relevant links, step by step guides etc.

## I have a feature request

Before opening a new issue, please:

- search for duplicate issues to prevent opening a duplicate feature request. If there is already an open existing request, please leave a comment there.
- add as much information as possible. For example: give us a clear explanation of why you think the feature request is something we should consider for CORE.
